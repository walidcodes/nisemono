# Nisemono

From a static image design to a fully fledged animated webpage with custom made buttons and animations.

## How it's made:

**Tech used**: HTML & CSS

Applied a pre-existing static design in code. I then reimagined the project as one that is animated and proceeded to make various custom detailed animations including buttons, navbars for both header and footer, three different types of carousels. The page also uses images that are edited using imaging editing software such as photoshop to put them in motion. I proceeded to make the page responsive with multiple break points giving a different experience for each screen size. This project was large and demanded a design that isn't hackneyed and assembled using typical template library designed.

## Optimizations:

Mobile screensize, although functional, could use more precision with sizing of certain elements. The bulk of the work exceeded my expectations and taught me plenty.
